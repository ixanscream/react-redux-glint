React Redux Glint Tes
=========================



git clone https://github.com/ixanscream/react-redux-glint.git

go to react-redux-glint folder to install all node modules

type => 

```
npm install
```

wait until finish

type => 

```
json-server --watch db.json
```

now the server is run on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000)

(http://localhost:3000/companies) companies

(http://localhost:3000/office) offices

(http://localhost:3000/phonecode) phone code


as you can see, there are several addresses to access datas

after the server is on, now we will run the application

open new terminal (cmd) in the same folder (react-redux-glint)
type => 

```
npm start
```

now u got warn "Something is already running on port 3000"
yes because we have used that port for the server

type => 

```Y``` 

now our application will run on port 3001  (http://localhost:3001)
 
if you want to debug redux with dev tool, please open the store.js file and delete the comment that I marked

```
//,window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()
